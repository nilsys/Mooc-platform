    <p>Run all of these if you haven't already in order to get the courses and be able to read them offline.
      Clicking on them anytime after the first time will just update them</p>
    <p class="Note">
      Important! After clicking wait for about 10-50 seconds until the courses have been downloaded.
      A notification is going to popup once everything is done.
      You need internet connection for that.
      After that, wait while the database is being updated.
      <br><br>If you skip this page everything is going to work apart from offline functionality.
